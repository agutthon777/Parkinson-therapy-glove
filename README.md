# Parkinson's Disease Vibrotherapy Glove

This repository contains the source code and design files for a Parkinson's disease vibrotherapy glove. The glove utilizes vibration therapy to help manage the symptoms of Parkinson's disease. 

The project employs an Arduino Nano to control coin motors, which are placed strategically in the glove's fingers. The motors are programmed to vibrate in a specific sequence and duration based on therapeutic research findings. The goal is to provide a cost-effective and wearable solution for individuals affected by Parkinson's disease.

## Features:

- Utilizes Arduino Nano for control.
- Employs 4 coin motors for vibrotherapy.
- Customizable vibration patterns and duration.
- Low power requirements for portability and convenience.

## Code:
The provided Arduino sketch controls the coin motors, allowing for customizable vibration sequences and durations.

## Hardware:
The main components of the project include an Arduino Nano, coin vibration motors, and a power supply. The repository contains information about the circuit used and how to build the glove. 

Please note, while the project's aim is therapeutic, it does not replace professional medical advice. Always consult with a healthcare provider for treatment options. 

Contributions to improve the design or the code are very welcome.

## Future work:
- Adding wireless control to customize vibration patterns.
- Including sensors to monitor effectiveness.
- Improving power management for longer battery life.
